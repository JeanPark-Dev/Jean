        <p>Hello! My name is Jinyoung and I am a graduate at the University of Canterbury major in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>The thing that I enjoy programming as follows:
            <li>Building a program is cool!</li>
            <li>A feeling of accomplishment from solving complecated problems</li>
            During my time in university, I learned many programming languages such as Python, Java, SQL, Prolog and Web development 
            languages (HTML, php, JavaScript, Node.js)
        </p>
